# Meet-and-Eat
An iteratively evaluated prototype to enhance meal planning for familys.

## Method

Meal planning for familys often takes a lot of effort and time. Because of that we developed an interactive prototype with the method Contextual Design (by Karen Holtzblatt), that makes the meal planning more efficient and effective.

In order to do this we conducted research to get to know the users, the use context and environment. We observed several participants during their planning of the meals for the next week and during shopping of the ingredients.

We sorted and structured the recorded data in a Affinity Diagram, created several different models (like Day In The Life, Identity Model) and developed design ideas for the product.

The first prototype created out of these insights was made as a paper prototype and was used for the first testing with real users. The feedback from this first iteration was used to build the next, second prototype digitally in Axure. This version was tested with the users as well and then used to build the final prototype within our project phase.

The next steps would be to make a good visual design for our prototype and to begin developing it as a tablet and smartphone App - again with more and more user testing.
